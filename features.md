## Contributors

Name: Kenneth Koon

Student number: z5534191

## Completed

Minimum Viable Product/Prototype (MVP):

* User should be able to enter Character name.
* User is able to choose tasks for the character.
* A list of chosen tasks in a table is shown to the user.
* Users can check tasks they have completed.

"Nice to have" (NTH):

* Users can enter multiple characters and choose tasks for each individual character.
* Data should persist through server closing / tab closing / reload.
* Users should be able to add/delete characters and add/delete tasks.
* Users can delete the entire tracker and start from scratch.
* Tasks are separated by Daily or Weekly on HTML Display for accessibility reasons.

Stretch Goals (SG):

* Using JavaScript, checkboxes will stay checked on reload / tab closing / server closing, simply when checked, without the need for a submit button.
* Using JavaScript, checkboxes automatically reset to unchecked based on daily / weekly reset timers.
* Some tasks, if not completed before their reset timer, will gain 'rest bonus' allowing the player to earn more loot the next time they complete it. Rest Bonus should accumulate automatically if the check isn't ticked and be displayed by the activity.
* Users can create a profile for their tracker and be able to access it on multiple machines.
* Allow users to customise their templates however they please.
